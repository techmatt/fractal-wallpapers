Judging finished renders: what to colour, how to colour it, what to keep, and
what to make at full size.

This is the last stage. Everything upstream produces *supply* — places a walk
found, judges trained on human verdicts, a palette head that ranks colour choices.
Curation spends it: it turns the union of every walk into a small set of finished
wallpapers and a durable account of why those and not the others.

## A run accumulates; the gallery pass chooses

The two halves used to be one command, and Matt split them on 2026-08-22. The two
phases have names: **the pool phase** is `curate run`, and **the GALLERY PASS** is
`curate gallery` — one global selection over everything the pool holds, re-runnable,
each pass a record, the previous gallery superseded rather than deleted.

**A run is the pool phase.** It reads the offer, colorizes, records every candidate
it made and every verdict on it, and keeps a **diagnostic** release of ten pictures —
enough to see that the path works, that the heads are reading the material and
that the palette pass is not producing one look. It does not try to decide what is
worth shipping: that is a judgement over the whole accumulated pool, and one
night's attempts are a few hundred rows of it.

Three things follow, and all three are in this stage now:

* **A run never refuses a place because an earlier run released it.** `curate run`
  used to build the served index and veto every candidate whose place the
  collection already had — one run's seats deciding the next run's coverage, out
  of the fraction of the pool it happened to hold. One wallpaper per location
  still acts *inside* a run, through the counter both heads share, and
  `served_locations` is now read only by the collection-level passes.
* **Every release row says which collection it is in.** `records.DIAGNOSTIC` for a
  run's own, `records.GALLERY` for what the collection ships. A field and not a
  fourth verdict: the three verdicts answer whether there is a wallpaper at the
  end of the row, and this answers which set it belongs to.
* **Nothing released so far is the collection's.** All 1,050 rows on record are
  `diagnostic`, backfilled in the same commit, because none of them was ever
  chosen against a pool.

## `curate gallery` — the seven steps, and the two knobs that are by eye

One command, and **not a run type**: no ledger binding, no pacing clock, no
harvest state, because a selection over an accumulated pool has none of those.
Each invocation is a **pass** with its own id, its own record in
`data/curation/gallery/`, and its own slice of the pool's decision store.

```
1  slots per partition   release_mix over a POOL-WIDE denominator (24,843 admitted
                         locations, not one binding's offer); release_caps and the
                         guarantee re-derived over it. The thin-supply cap is
                         thousands wide at that denominator and binds nothing —
                         computed and reported anyway, so a pass and a run are
                         comparable.
2  head split            per PARTITION, by --strange-share (0.6). The heads are
                         dealt across a partition's picks by largest deficit, so
                         neither judge gets the whole top of a partition.
3  the distance          artifacts/curation/neutral_embeddings.jsonl, refused
                         unless `curate embeddings check` says it is whole
4  the locations         quality-weighted farthest point under a HARD RADIUS
5  the attempts          m locations near each chosen point, judged small
6  the seats             both measured floors ACT; P(>=4), P(>=3) tiebreak
7  the pictures          2560x1440 ss4 for the winners, and only for them
```

**The draw is `gain = distance x location P(>=4) ** gamma`,** where `distance` is
cosine distance to the *nearest* already-chosen point. The first pick of a
partition is its strongest location, with nothing to be far from. `--radius`
(0.07) is a hard constraint under all of it: nothing that close to a chosen point
may be chosen, whatever its quality. `--quality-weight` is `gamma` and defaults to
**1** — a plain product, so a location half as far and twice as good is worth the
same; `0` is pure farthest point, which spends slots on the most isolated places
in the pool whatever the judge says. Not k-means, which follows density: this
pool's density records where the walk spent its budget, so a neighbourhood
somebody visited a thousand times would take a thousand times the slots.

Both numbers are by eye, and every pass prints the instrument that calibrates
them: a **retro table** of the nearest chosen pairs, per partition and overall,
with their distances, plus a second contact sheet showing what the radius refused
next to each chosen point at its neutral render. If two rows of the retro table
read as one picture, the radius is too small.

**Both measured floors act here, and only one of them acts at a run's release.**
`floors.gallery_floor` is that seam and it is the one place in this project where
a head's cut reads differently at two sites: `ACTING_RELEASE_BARS` still answers
*does this head gate a run's release* and the smooth head's answer there is still
no, while the pass reads `MEASURED_RELEASE_FLOORS` on both heads — strange 0.685,
smooth 0.385. The two questions are different. A run's release is ten diagnostic
pictures out of one night, and a bar there decides how much of that night is worth
looking at; the pass decides what the collection ships out of everything, and a
slot it cannot fill above a measured floor is a fact about the pool. **Unfilled
beats padded**: an empty slot is output with its binding reason named, because it
is the signal for where to label or walk next.

**The pass has a colorize leg, and every chosen point gets both heads' attempts.**
`--attempts m,smooth,strange` (3,2,6) buys, for each chosen point, the top `m`
locations in its own radius by `P(>=4)`, each under `smooth` attempts on distinct
palette anchors and `strange` attempts on distinct modes — 24 attempts a slot,
about a minute. The attempts are **pool rows**, stamped with the pass id, so the
pool grows by every one of them; the plan is taken over the *union* of every
slot's locations, because two overlapping neighbourhoods asking for one location
would otherwise render the same pictures twice (the mode draw is seeded off the
location and the head). The 31 palette candidates that lost are deleted after the
verdict — the row keeps the whole candidate set by name and the head's score for
each, which is what a later reader needs. `--no-attempts` skips the leg and is a
**dev affordance only**: without it the pass is bound to whatever fraction of the
admitted population some run happened to colour, which today is 475 locations out
of 24,843.

**One wallpaper per location acts inside the pass and the served index is not
read.** A run is excused from the index because it has the wrong population; the
pass has exactly the right one and is excused for a different reason — a pass
chooses the whole gallery at once and **supersedes** the previous one, so a pass
that refused every place the last pass shipped could not re-choose its own
gallery, and one that refused every place a run's diagnostic release sits on would
hand the collection's best locations to the ten pictures a night kept to prove its
path worked.

**The pass's pictures live in the run tree** (`artifacts/curation/runs/<pass>/`),
deliberately: `curation.rescore` finds any pool row's candidate render at
`runs/<run>/pictures/<candidate>.jpg` off the row's own `run` field, and a pass
that stored its pictures elsewhere would be a pass whose rows the next re-score
refuses to read. Both contact sheets are written to `scratch/`, self-contained
with their thumbnails embedded.

## What a pass puts in the history, and what it puts beside it

**Everything a pass tracks scales with `n`; nothing tracked scales with the
attempts.** That is a rule, it is measured on every pass, and
`tests/test_curation_gallery.py` pins it on a synthetic N=500 plan by writing the
same 500 seats under two attempt counts an order of magnitude apart and demanding
the tracked bytes come out the same to within the manifest's own digits.

```
data/curation/gallery/<pass>/pass.json              knobs, the plan, the retro
                                                    table, the seating tally,
                                                    timings
data/curation/gallery/<pass>/<partition>.jsonl      one row per slot: the chosen
                                                    point (key + embedding index),
                                                    its neighbourhood, the fill
                                                    arithmetic, the seat by key,
                                                    the refusal by slug
data/curation/gallery/<pass>/gate.manifest.json     rows, bytes, sha256, population
data/curation/release/<pass>/<partition>.jsonl      the WINNERS, at most n of them
artifacts/curation/gallery/<pass>/gate.jsonl        every attempt, one pool row each
<archive>/curation_backup/gallery/<pass>/gate.jsonl the durable copy
```

`gallery.read_pass` puts the record back together — the summary with its slots
re-attached in slot order — so nothing has to know about the file axis. **The
slots split on partition for the same reason the decision stores do**: a slot row
runs about a kilobyte, N=500 is 1.3 MiB, and the history guard acts per file.
gallery1 at N=50 tracks **337 KB over twenty files, the largest 52 KB**.

**The attempts are the bulk and they are not in the history.** A pass makes
`locations x heads x draws` attempts per slot — 1,120 at n=50, ten times that at
n=500 — and a pool row carrying its whole join runs about 3.8 KB. They get the
`neutral_embeddings` treatment: under the regenerable tree, a copy on the archive
tier, a tracked manifest, and `curate gallery-store {check,save,restore}` over
them. The pass writes the copy and the manifest itself as its last act.

**A pass no longer writes a release row per attempt.** It used to write both a
gate row and a release row for every scored attempt, which is the same row twice
and the second copy in the history. Measured on gallery1's own 1,120 attempts,
the old layout would have tracked **7.84 MB** — 4.06 MB of release rows with the
largest partition file at 0.86 MiB against the 1 MiB guard, 3.59 MB of gate rows,
and a 197 KB single-file pass record — per pass, kept forever. The release store now answers
only the question it exists for, *which candidate took a slot*, and a pass takes
at most `n` of those decisions. What each slot passed over is not lost: it is on
the slot as `eligible` / `below_floor` / `location_served`, in the tracked pass
record, and the rows themselves are in the attempt store. A **run** still writes
its passed-over rows into the tracked store, and that is not an inconsistency —
a run's population is one night that will not exist again, and a pass's is the
accumulated pool, which is still there.

**A later pass reads both stores.** `gallery.pool_candidates` reads the release
store *and* every earlier pass's attempt store, because an earlier pass's
thousand-odd attempts are standing coloured judged candidates and are the largest
single block of material a second pass can seat without rendering anything.

**`curate gallery` refuses the pre-split layout** — a tracked gate directory under
the pass id, or a passed-over release row in the history — before it spends
anything, because a pass run over it would upsert its winners into a directory
still holding every attempt the old code passed over. `curate gallery --pass <id>
--migrate` moves one pass across: attempt rows into the new store with its
manifest, the release directory rewritten to the winners alone. It reads and
writes records only and renders nothing. It is idempotent.

## The gallery pass needs a distance, so every admitted location has a vector

The gallery pass picks by **quality-weighted farthest point with a hard radius**,
which needs to know how far apart two locations look. `curate embed` is what
answers that: for every location the location judge admits over the junk floor
(**24,779** today), one **neutral render** through one fixed cyclic map at one
fixed small geometry, and the unit vector a frozen DINOv2 reads off it.

* **Locations, never candidates.** A candidate is a location already coloured,
  and the gallery pass chooses the colouring afterwards. Palette diversity is the
  neighbourhood draw's job upstream.
* **Frozen choices, and a stamp that makes a thaw visible.** `twilight_shifted`,
  448x252 at one sample per pixel, `smooth`, linear, no mirror; DINOv2 ViT-S/14
  at 384 dimensions, L2-normalized, stored `float16`. `neutral.stamp()` digests
  all of it, the manifest records the digest, every row carries it, and a leg
  that would append a second provenance refuses.
* **Incremental and idempotent.** The keys already stored are subtracted before
  anything is drawn, so a later harvest's admissions are a second run of the same
  command and a killed leg resumes on the rows and pictures it left behind.
* **One writer.** The leg takes `artifacts/curation/embedding.lock` through
  `models.train.claim`. Two of these appending to one JSONL interleave
  half-written rows into it; that is measured, not hypothetical.
* **The vectors are durable, the JPEGs are not.** `curate embeddings
  save|check|restore`, the same three verbs `curate sidecar` has. The pictures
  regenerate from the store's own rows — every row carries its family, viewport
  and maxiter — so they are counted in the manifest and not copied.

**The mode table and the strange share are parameters, not constants.**
`--strange-modes` and `--strange-share` are part of a run's recorded shape, so a
resumed run takes the table it was planned with; the defaults are
`budget.MODES_PER_LOCATION` and `run.STRANGE_SHARE` — **0.6** from 2026-08-22, on
Matt's call, because the strange judge is the one with a seventeen-mode roster and
an acting bar to get past while the smooth judge has one coloring and an advisory.
A night's `--finish-by` reservation now asks `curation.budget` what that shape
will actually plan, instead of restating the attempt multiplier, the share and the
mode count in `schedule` — three copies that were correct only while all three of
the originals were fixed.

Everything a run makes at full size is **2560x1440 supersample 4** —
`run.RELEASE_RESOLUTION` and `run.RELEASE_SUPERSAMPLE`, one geometry for every
partition, every mode and every head, so nothing about a release row's cost or
its bytes depends on which slot it took, and `checks` re-derives against those
same two constants.

What follows is worth reading before changing anything.

**A candidate set is a neighbourhood and the pick is made on one field.** The
thirty-two maps are `palettes.space.neighbourhood(anchor, pool, 32)` — the
nearest maps to a drawn anchor in a fixed Oklab metric over the gradient as the
renderer spends it — so the head is asked the fine distinction it was distilled
to make rather than an obvious one, and the set is a pure function of the tracked
library and the anchor. Anchors are drawn **without replacement across a run**,
which is the cheap spread rule: two locations in one release do not come out of
the same region of palette space. Every candidate is a *recolor of one dumped
smooth field* — one iteration pass per location instead of thirty-two, and the
pictures the head reads are the smooth renders it was distilled on. The chosen
map then colours whatever mode the attempt actually draws.

**A run is bound to its ledgers, and nothing defaults to all of them.** `--ledger`
names them; `--harvest` names the run that wrote them and takes its `walk.jsonl`.
`curate run` resolves the binding at its entry, writes it into `run_plan.json`
beside `n` and the seed, and every stage downstream reads it from there — a resume
names no ledger and is bound by its own plan. An invocation that names none with
more than one ledger present **refuses and lists them**. The old default was to
read every `walk.jsonl` under `artifacts/`, which would have ranked one harvest's
17,251 unscored rows into another harvest's intake and printed one funnel over
both populations, with nothing raising and nothing looking wrong.

**The head's rank orders the offer; its level is not a quantity.** An earlier
standing rule said never to order or gate the mandelbrot offer by location-head
rank. `mandelbrot_offer_body` (n=150, five equal-count score bands over the
offer's junk-floor survivors, 2026-08-19) contradicts it on the order: quality
decays monotonically with the head's `P(≥3)` — ρ = 0.582 over the body, 0.410
within bands 1–4 alone, 90% keepers in the top two fifths against 46.7% in the
fourth — so intake's best-first read is right and the rule is retired. What that
batch did *not* rescue is the calibrated level: the head corrected downward on
38.7% of the body and upward on 4.0%, and seven of its 36 tier-4 prefills held.
The score is therefore a rank and never a height, and the only cuts placed on it
are floors.

**That validation measured the retired head's ranks.** It was read through
`4b60deb9…` in 2026-08-19, and the head serving since 2026-08-20 is a different
one that agrees with it at ρ = 0.891 over the standing supply. Reading the offer
best-first is still what this module does; whether the *candidate's* ranks decay
with quality as cleanly is **unmeasured**, and it stays unmeasured until a
decision needs it — a second 150-row body is a labelling batch, not a check.

**Two cuts act here; everything else annotates.** `floors` owns every threshold.
The junk floor removes a row at intake, on the location head's scale, saying no
more than *do not spend colorize compute on this*. The **strange head's release
bar** removes one at selection: a strange row below 0.685 is not seated, and a
strange slot with nothing above it goes unfilled.

Both are [`Restatement`]s now, and so are the supply engine's two — the good floor
and the great cut, which sit on the same location head and are owned by
`supply.currency`. Those two are **not nested**, because they are cuts on two
different cutpoints of it: the good floor reads `P(≥3)` and the great cut reads
`P(≥4)`, so a frame can clear one and fail the other. `currency.good_class` reads
the floor **first** and answers `None` below it — a frame the run would not keep
has no verdict about how unkeepable it is — and only then asks the great cut
whether the keeper is a 4 or a 3.

A height is declared with the sha of the artifact it was
measured on, the cut is stamped with **that** sha rather than with whatever is
live, and a head flip therefore refuses at the first comparison instead of
quietly deciding on a scale that no longer exists. The junk floor was the last
holdout — described for most of a year as the one cut a flip could leave alone,
because it is coarse and semantic rather than calibrated. It was not: at the
2026-08-20 flip, 0.20 on the new head would have removed 2,086 more locations
from the colorize pool than 0.20 on the old one. Semantic is not scale-free.

Both render judges shipped as advisories — computed, written onto every record,
never allowed to drop a candidate — because neither had a measured release gate
and a bar without one is a number nobody can defend. The strange bar is an
exception taken deliberately, by review rather than by measurement: Matt read
`run2` on 2026-08-17, and all eleven released strange rows below the advisory were
bad, the head had been right about every one, and the release path had been
padding strange slots out of thin passing supply. Its *height* is no longer that
verdict: the 4-class retrain moved the head's whole probability scale, so the bar
was restated off the labels — the crossover where the head's own P(>=3) stops
disagreeing with the people who judged 3,085 pictures — and it landed at 0.685
rather than at the advisory it was promoted from. **The smooth head stays
advisory** — its below-advisory rows belong to a mix-ratio decision that has not
been taken. An `Advisory` and a `Bar` are two classes rather than one class with
a flag, so which kind a head has is visible at every call site.

**Nothing is frozen into a row.** Scores are read at the moment they are used, out
of a sidecar this stage owns — upserted per ledger, so scoring one binding
replaces that binding's rows and leaves every other ledger's alone; the walk
ledgers themselves are never rewritten. The *read* back is the other way round —
`ranked` looks the sidecar up **unscoped**, because the binding decides which
places are on offer and a score is a statement about a place, so a location this
binding offers that some other invocation already scored keeps its number instead
of arriving unscored and dying at the floor. A
verdict stamped into a ledger on the day it was minted is a verdict the pipeline
must later either believe or delete, and deleting is how a head flip once took an
intake from about fourteen hundred locations to sixteen. Here a flip is a
re-score, and a stale score costs *rank quality* rather than a row.

**Closing a reach gap costs what the gap is, not what the ledger is.** `curate
reach` names the judged locations the pass cannot select, and it separates two
causes: *below the junk floor* is a judgement, and *absent from the sidecar* is a
place whose ledger was never scored. `curate reach --write <path>` writes the
second set as a **key manifest** — JSONL, one `{schema, key, partition}` a line —
and `curate score --key-file <path>` scores exactly those rows out of the bound
ledgers. Like `--limit`, it is a partial pass: it upserts what it looked at and
clears nothing, because deleting the rows it declined to score would be a partial
pass silently truncating a complete one.

That distinction is worth about an hour, and it used to be worth thirteen. On
2026-08-22 the 68 unreached locations sat on three old ledgers (`harvest`,
`walk_demo`, `walk_j`) holding 22,898 gate survivors between them; the 68
themselves cost one batch and took `curate reach` from 68 absent to **0**.
Scoring those ledgers whole was the separate, larger leg, and it was priced at
thirteen hours only while it was priced at the deploy geometry.

**A row that states no regime is read at the node one.** The head reads three
trained geometries and one scale acts across all of them, but the *picture* is not
one picture: a walk scores its own 384x216 ss1 gate render and stamps the regime
and the recipe's digest onto every row it writes. `curate score` reads a row at
the regime the row states — the walk's own picture where the digest still
describes it, a 384x216 ss1 re-render where it does not. A row that states none
has never been scored here at all, so this stage chooses, and the choice is
`intake.READ_REGIME`: the node regime, like every walk node, **never** the deploy
geometry. The regime is stamped onto the sidecar row as provenance, so an
unstated regime becomes a stated one the moment a score is written off it.

`artifacts/location_views` is therefore **frozen, full stop** — the read-only
record of what was scored at the deploy geometry before a walk scored its own
frames, and not a cache that grows by three gigabytes the first time old stock is
offered. That is a ruling and not an equivalence: it holds *because the location
head is regime-robust* — one scale across all three built regimes, the property
the adopted checkpoint was selected for — which is what makes a node-regime read
of old stock comparable with everything else in the pool.

**What the leg cost, measured.** 2026-08-22, RTX 2060 SUPER, hot tier: 22,630
never-scored rows of those three ledgers in **3,363 s over twelve 2,000-row
chunks**, one chunk a checkpoint, **0.149 s/row realized** against a 200-row
pilot's 0.123 (harvest) / 0.169 (walk_demo) / 0.029 (walk_j). Not the 2.89 s the
deploy geometry cost: these are gate survivors and the cost is what the pixels do,
not how many there are. About **8.1 s of that is fixed per invocation** — imports,
the head onto the GPU, the ledger read, and the sidecar rewritten whole — which is
what sets the chunk size. It wrote **1.48 GB / 22,898 files** into
`artifacts/node_views/384x216ss1/` and nothing anywhere else.

**The release budgets the colorize, never the other way round.** A judge's attempt
budget is a multiple of the slots it is asked to fill, and when the two cannot
both be afforded they scale down together. Volume that falls out of a spread over
render styles gives the one smooth coloring a sixteenth of the attempts however
many smooth slots the release wanted — a release starved by an allocation rule
that had no opinion about the release.

**Attempts and locations stopped being the same count.** `floors.ATTEMPT_MULTIPLIER`
is 4 *locations* a slot: how far into a partition's ranked offer a head reaches.
`budget.MODES_PER_LOCATION` is how many colorize attempts each of those locations
costs — 1 for the smooth judge, whose roster is the one smooth coloring, and **2
for the strange judge**, which draws two different modes per location without
replacement (`colorize.modes_drawn_for`, seeded off the location and the head so
a resume re-derives the pair). run10 seated 15 of 40 strange slots with 115
candidates below the acting bar and seven of nine partitions short, off one
uniformly drawn mode a location. The second draw reaches no further into the
offer, so the release cap's arithmetic is untouched and the location rule sees the
same places; what it buys is a second reading of each, at ~2.4 s. An 80-slot
release is 480 attempts, not 320.

**The funnel is printed with three denominators, not one.** `found` is every gate
survivor the binding holds, `scored` is how many of those the sidecar has an
opinion about, and `passing`/`good` are counted over `scored` and never over
`found`. The junk floor is the only cut intake applies — the survivors above it
are the whole offer, and everything else here annotates. The first production
run printed "22,751 found, 1,245 above the junk floor", which put every gate
survivor in a denominator only the scored prefix could reach, and reported a
fifth of the real rate.

**Nothing is padded, backfilled or redistributed.** A judge that cannot fill its
quota under the caps ships fewer and says so with the three numbers that make the
shortfall attributable. A slot a thin partition could not use is not handed to a
partition that had plenty: that is the thin-supply rule undone one level up. With
the strange bar acting the same rule has an edge — the allocation is still solved
over the partitions that have a *scored* candidate, not over the ones that have a
passing one, so a partition the bar empties holds its slot and leaves it unfilled
rather than exporting it. Every run reports planned against seated against
unfilled, per head and per partition, with the reason each shortfall bound on.

**One wallpaper per location, collection-wide** (Matt, 2026-08-22). A location is
never released twice — not in one run, not across runs, not in two modes or two
palettes. "Same location" is the near-duplicate group `labeling.groups.assign`
already defines, and `floors.CLUSTER_CAP` is now **1** over that grouping with the
whole collection as its scope. `curation.served_locations` reads the tracked
release records into an index of served places at run start;
`selection.grouped` groups the index and *both heads'* candidates in one call,
because a group id is a position in a connected-components labelling and tags
from two calls are unrelated — which is also what makes the cap apply to the
union of the two heads' seats rather than to each of them. A refused candidate is
logged `location_served` with a `cause` of `prior_run` or `this_run`, and the run
summary counts both. **Higher-ranked keeps**: the pool is score-ordered, so the
refused row is always the weaker reading. A resume excludes its own run from the
index or its second half would refuse every seat its first half took.

Read against run9, which had the old rule: 48 seats become **27** — 14 refused as
places an earlier run had served, 7 as a second seat inside run9. Both heads still
attempt every location, so what the second attempt buys is the better reading
rather than a second wallpaper — and the strange judge now makes two of its own
per location for the same reason, which is the one place the attempt plan has been
sized against this rule. `fractal-wallpapers curate repeats` is the report-only read of the rule
against what the collection already holds. Perceptual similarity is a different
question and is not this.

**The rule was applied backwards once, and that is a second way a row leaves
service.** The rule acts at selection and cannot reach backwards, so the
collection it began on was still holding 27 locations twice or more.
`curate retire-repeats` (Matt, 2026-08-22) keeps the highest `P(>=3)` of each
group **on its own head's scale, uncompared** — the two finished-render judges are
calibrated separately and a cross-scale adjustment would be a number nobody has
measured — with ties to the later run, and stamps the other 32 rows
`location_served` with the survivor's key on the row. 185 served became **153**,
zero locations hold more than one, and `tests/test_served_locations.py` pins both.
It is a separate pass from `curate reject` and not a mode of it: that one reads
the bars live and must go on excusing the four ruled run8h rows, while this one
reads no bar at all and can retire a perfectly good picture for being the second
one of a place. One of the four ruled rows was retired by it — the ruling settled
whether failing a bar takes a row out of service, which is not the question the
location rule asks — and a pass names any such row rather than skipping it.

**A release can be wrong, and taking a row back adds to the record.** `rejection`
stamps a released row with who rejected it, when, and against which bar and
artifact; `verdict` stays `released`, the scores are untouched, nothing is
deleted. `records.served` is what every listing, every check and the sheet read, so a row
leaves service everywhere at once — and it is three conditions rather than one:
released, not rejected, **and** with a release picture to serve. The third is not
redundant with the first. A set defined on the verdict alone would be one schema
change away from serving a link to nothing, which is exactly what the
[record store](../../../data/curation/README.md) records happening. The
sheet keeps it on the page under its own heading, because a review page that
disagreed with its own records would be the one thing a review page may not be.
`curate reject` applies today's acting bars to a run released before they acted,
which is a rule rather than a list, and re-running it rewrites the same bytes.

**A ruling that keeps a row in service is a tracked record, or it is not a
ruling.** That rule is live and idempotent, so it finds the same rows every time
it is asked — which is why an *unwritten* exception is dangerous rather than
merely undocumented. Four run8h strange rows sit below the 0.685 bar and stay
served on Matt's reading of the sheet; `data/curation/bar_exceptions.jsonl` names
them one by one, with the bar, the score, who ruled and when, and
`rejection.below_acting_bar` passes over exactly those keys. It is per *row*: an
exception naming a run would go on excusing rows that run has not made yet, and
one naming a head would retire the bar by the back door. A pass names what it
excused in its report.

**Serving order is score rank within the partition, on each head's own scale.**
`records.score_rank` ranks every `(partition, head)` pool separately and then
interleaves the pools by *position*, so no sort ever compares the two judges'
probabilities and every prefix of a listing covers the partitions evenly — the
property the near-miss section needs, because it takes a prefix. The served set
used to come out in candidate order, which is the attempt number, which is
arrival order: a page led with whichever partition the attempt plan interleaved
first. Floors are untouched by this. The junk floor still acts at intake and an
acting release bar still refuses a seat; rank only orders what survived them.

**Where a run's clock goes.** Profiled serially over a real run: the release pass is
the run, and painting is the release pass. A full-resolution row is ~90% engine, and
inside the engine 97% is painting — resampling is 2.6% and process start, PNG encode
and the write together are 0.3%, so encode and file I/O are not worth counting here.
An attempt is 2.49 s, half of it the thirty-two candidate recolors (36.6 ms each, one
engine process apiece, each re-reading the same 3.7 MB field) — run10 came in at
2.42 over 320 of them. At the shipped shape that used to be roughly 80% release,
17% attempts; the second strange mode a location moves it, and run10's own legs
re-priced come to about 22.8 min of release against 19.4 of attempts.

**A run is sized by a clock as well as by `-n`, and the gate is prospective.** At
six pictures the size of a run is `-n`; at sixty it is the wall clock, because one
release row measured between 14.9 s and 1084.6 s (median 69.1 over 204 tracked
rows) turns "twenty rows" into an
answer between five minutes and six hours. `--wall-budget` is
checked *before* each unit — `elapsed + estimate + margin > budget` and it does not
start — off an estimate formed from this run's own finished units, with a hard kill
deadline covering the first unit of a class, which by construction has no estimate.
Stopping is an outcome: the summary says `budget_stopped`, which is neither
`completed` nor `crashed`, so a short release is attributable to the clock rather
than mistaken for thin supply.

**A deep release is a different cost class, and `--deep` is what says so.** The
hung-unit backstop (`pacing.HUNG_CEILING`) is a fixed ceiling per leg, sized
against the shallow release row distribution (`pacing.RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION`:
14.9-1084.6 s, median 69.1 s over the 204 tracked rows) and raised only by units a
run has *finished* — so a class whose first row dies at the ceiling never teaches the
run that the class is slow. Two 2560x1440 ss4 frames from
[the deep run mode](../deep/README.md) were measured at **531 s and 607 s**, at
widths `8.07e-10` and `7.07e-11` and iteration caps near 46 000. `curate run
--deep` swaps in `deep.run.HUNG_CEILING` (colorize 1200 s, release 2400 s) for
the whole run; the clock records which set each leg was held to, so a summary
says it rather than implying it. It is an *execution* flag, like `--workers`: it
is not part of a run's shape and a resume may carry a different one.

**A production night is three legs, and the wall budget is what the first two
leave.** Harvest, then `curate score` over the harvest it just wrote, then `curate
run` — separate invocations, so a failure in one does not take the finished work of
the ones before it. `--wall-budget` is the curation's alone, not the night's, so it
is computed at launch rather than written down: `total − harvest spent − reserve`,
where the reserve is what the readout and the write-up need after the last picture
lands. The other direction is `harvest --finish-by HH:MM --release-slots N`, which
reserves this leg's release pass out of the night's span and hands the harvest what
is left — see [the supply engine](../supply/README.md) for
every term it subtracts. A night capped at six hours with a three-hour harvest therefore hands the
curation a little under three, and the curation is the leg that will stop early —
`-n` binds it long before the clock does.

**Restore `artifacts/curation` before the night starts.** Both halves of this
stage live in it — `supply_scores.jsonl`, which every intake ranks against, and
`runs/<run>/release/`, where every full-resolution picture is written — so a night
launched with the subtree archived reads its supply and writes its pictures
seek-bound on a USB disk. `fractal-wallpapers storage restore curation` is the
pre-flight, and it is cheap next to what it saves: 895 directories, 28,112 files
and 6.01 GiB, measured at **2.8 min cold** (28–37 MiB/s across the bulk leg, 170
files/s) and 70 s over a warm source. `storage status --no-sizes` says which tier
it is on without walking the archive to answer.

**The supply sidecar is the one input a run cannot recover from, so it is kept
twice and counted before every run.** `artifacts/curation/supply_scores.jsonl` is
the location head's read of the standing supply — 67,586 rows as of 2026-08-22 —
and it is not regenerable from the checkout, because `curate score` rebuilds it
from the walk ledgers and those are under the regenerable tree too.
[`durability`](durability.py) owns what follows from that: a copy on the archive
tier under its own top-level name (`artifacts/curation_backup/`, a *copy* rather
than a `storage archive` move, which is why it cannot share the `curation` name
the tiers arbitrate), a tracked manifest at
`data/curation/supply_scores.manifest.json` carrying rows, bytes, sha256 and the
per-ledger split, and a guard at the top of `curate run` that refuses when the
live file is missing or shorter than the manifest records. The pre-flight is one
line:

```
fractal-wallpapers curate sidecar check      # live file against the manifest
fractal-wallpapers curate sidecar save       # after a harvest: fresh copy + manifest
fractal-wallpapers curate sidecar restore    # bring the copy back, count-verified
```

`save` after every `curate score` and before the release leg. `check` reports
`grown` between a harvest and the next `save`, which is the ordinary state and not
a fault; `short` and `missing` are the two it exists to catch, and they exit
non-zero.

**A run name is claimed once.** A `curate run` whose name already has a
`run_plan.json` refuses: continuing an interrupted run is `--resume`, and it is a
decision rather than a default. A `--resume` that contradicts the stored plan
refuses too, and names both shapes, because a second plan's attempts written into
the first plan's log is not a thing a later reader can unpick.

**An interrupted run is continued, not restarted.** `--resume` skips what the run
already finished, off the run's own candidate log and the pictures on disk. Its
plan comes from the sidecar it wrote at entry rather than from the command line, so
a forgotten flag cannot re-plan a run half of whose attempts are recorded; nothing
half-written is trusted; and the seam is checked arithmetically — `planned =
resumed + made + failed + not-started` on both legs, loudly and non-zero when it
does not balance.

The two claims this stage makes that a test cannot settle are settled by commands
against a real plan — `curate parity`, that a concurrently rendered release is
byte-identical to a serial one, and `curate replay`, that every released picture
re-derives from its own record.
